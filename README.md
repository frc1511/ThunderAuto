## App Usage

ThunderAuto is designed to be a comprehensive desktop app used to plan Autonomous Paths for FRC Robots. On launch, the user is prompted to create a new project or open an existing project. When creating a new project, several settings can be configured, such as the max velocity and acceleration, dimensions of the robot, and the field image.

When the project is created, a number of windows are presented to the user, including the Path Selector, Path Editor, and Properties Editor.

The Path Selector window contains the functionality to select, create, delete, and rename paths. The Path Editor page renders the current path as a BÃ©zier curve on top of the field image. The trajectory is overlayed with a gradient representing the robot's velocity (blue = slow, red/pink = fast). The user can create/delete waypoints and adjust their attributes, such as the robot's desired position, rotation, and heading. Attributes can also be changed manually in the Properties Page under the 'Point' dropdown when a waypoint is selected in the Path Editor.

The robot can be flagged to stop at a waypoint by checking the 'Stop' checkbox in the Properties Page. This signals the app to calculate the robot's deceleration to a complete stop at the selected point and its subsequent acceleration as it continues the trajectory. When a waypoint is marked as stopped, the path editor de-couples the heading handles so that the robot can resume the path at a different angle from when it impacted the point.

ThunderAuto also has a unique feature called Actions which allows the user to flag specific actions for the robot to execute at points along the trajectory. A dropdown in the Properties window contains tools for the user to create/delete/rename the available Actions and  select whatever Actions they want applied to each waypoint.

When a path has been created to the user's satisfaction, the user can click the 'Export' button in the Properties Page under the Curve dropdown. This exports the selected path to a CSV file in the project's directory. The CSV file contains a long list of timestamps corresponding to the robot's desired position, rotation, velocity, and actions.

## Robot Code

The code required to execute a ThunderAuto trajectory on the robot does not need to be too elaborate because most of the motion calculations are done by the app before execution by the robot.

A simple example codebase can be found [here](https://github.com/petelilley/Homer).

### Movement

To start, the exported CSV file will need to be placed somewhere accessible on the robot, such as the deploy directory. Before the trajectory's execution, the robot program needs to [parse the CSV](https://github.com/petelilley/Homer/blob/main/src/Main/Trajectory/Trajectory.cpp#L43) and create two maps representing the path's States and Actions over time. When executing the trajectory, the robot must record the time elapsed and then [sample](https://github.com/petelilley/Homer/blob/main/src/Main/Trajectory/Trajectory.cpp#L62) the current State from the map of states. [Linear interpolation](https://github.com/petelilley/Homer/blob/main/src/Main/Trajectory/Trajectory.cpp#L94) between States can be added to attempt to smooth the trajectory. Using the current State (from odometry) and desired State, the WPILib [HolonomicDriveController](https://first.wpi.edu/wpilib/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/classfrc_1_1_holonomic_drive_controller.html) class can be used to adjust for error and produce the optimal axis velocities to move.

### Actions

To handle Actions, the robot program must contain a key of Actions matching the one in the app. During the path's execution, the program must compare the set bits in the current action bit-field with the available actions. When a match occurs, the code can execute any code relevant to that action. "Blocking" actions can be made by stopping the trajectory timer; however, these should only happen at stopped waypoints.

## Downloading

Download the latest release [here](https://github.com/petelilley/ThunderAuto/releases/latest).

## Building

Supported operating systems are Windows and macOS. Make sure to resolve all the git submodules before building!
```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
Build projects can be generated using CMake. Tested targets include Visual Studio 2019 or 2022 on Windows and Xcode or Unix Makefiles on macOS. 
```bash
# Configure Windows
cmake . -Bbuild -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```
```bash
# Configure macOS
cmake . -Bbuild -G "Xcode" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
```
```bash
# Build
cmake --build build
```

All the app's resources (Images, Fonts, etc.) are built into the executable, so there's no need to worry about moving them around once it's built.
